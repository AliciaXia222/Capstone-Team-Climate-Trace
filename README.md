## Abstract <a name="Abstract"></a>
This project develops a machine learning model to estimate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from building energy consumption. By predicting energy use intensity (EUI) using variables such as heating degree days (HDD), humidity, Human Development Index (HDI), educational index, income index, and GDP per capita, the model will generate estimates of energy consumption for both residential and non-residential buildings. These EUI estimates, along with global building floor area data provided by our client, will be used to calculate GHG emissions, offering a timely, high-resolution approach to estimating emissions at a global scale.


## Introduction <a name="Introduction"></a>

Global warming is one of the most critical challenges of our time, and addressing it requires accurately identifying the main sources of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Climate TRACE, a global non-profit coalition, has made significant progress in independently tracking emissions with a high level of detail, covering approximately 83% of global emissions. However, the building sector, which represents a substantial portion of global energy consumption and GHG emissions, lacks timely, high-resolution, low-latency data on energy use and related emissions. Current methods are often outdated, with data available only after a year or more, or rely on self-reported information that is not available on a global scale. This data gap limits policymakersâ€™ ability to focus their efforts effectively.

This project intends to develop a machine learning model to estimate GHG emissions based on building energy consumption. The model will predict energy use intensity (EUI) using predictive variables such as temperature, humidity, and socioeconomic data, along with global building floor area data from Climate TRACE. These EUI estimates will be used to calculate GHG emissions.
