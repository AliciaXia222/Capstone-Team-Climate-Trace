## 1. Abstract <a name="Abstract"></a>

This project develops a machine learning model to estimate direct greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from residential and non-residential building energy consumption. The model predicts energy use intensity (EUI) by incorporating climatic, geographical, and socioeconomic variables for both residential and non-residential buildings. These EUI estimates, along with global building floor area, will be used in the next stage of this project to calculate direct GHG emissions from buildings, offering a timely, high-resolution method for global emissions estimation. This current work outlines preliminary EUI estimation techniques, while future iterations will refine the model by incorporating additional features to enhance performance, ultimately addressing the challenge of estimating global direct GHG emissions from buildings.

Currently, the baseline linear regression model's performance varies across strategies and regions. Preliminary results show that the model performs best within-domain but struggles with generalization in cross-domain scenarios, with performance notably deteriorating in certain regions. These findings highlight the need for further iterations to improve accuracy.

Future models will test techniques such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest, and CatBoost, along with incorporating additional variables like average temperature and humidity to enhance predictive performance.



## 2. Introduction <a name="Introduction"></a>

### 2.1  Project Motivation  <a name="ProjectMotivation"></a>

Global warming is one of the most critical challenges of our time, and to address it effectively, we need more detailed information on where and when greenhouse gas emissions occur. This data is crucial for setting actionable emissions reduction goals and enabling policymakers to make informed decisions. Given this situation, Climate TRACE, a non-profit coalition of organizations, is building a timely, open, and accessible inventory of global emissions sources, currently covering around 83% of global emissions.

Building direct emissions are responsible for between 6% and 9% of global GHG emissions, primarily due to onsite fossil fuel combustion for heating, water heating, and cooking. Indirect emissions from lighting, consumer electronics, and air conditioning are excluded, as they are typically electric and accounted for separately in the Climate TRACE database.

Despite their significant contribution to global emissions, the building sector still lacks the timely, high-resolution, and low-latency data needed to assess GHG emissions accurately. Current methodologies rely on outdated data, often delayed by over a year, or on self-reported data that is scarce or unavailable globally.

### 2.2  Problem Statement  <a name="ProblemStatement"></a>

Specifically, we can define our problem statement as follows:

***The building sector lacks timely, high-resolution data on direct greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, limiting the ability to accurately track and reduce emissions from building energy use.***

### 2.3  Goals  <a name="Goals"></a>

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model to estimate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions based on building energy consumption. The model will predict energy use intensity (EUI) using climatic, geographical, and socioeconomic variables. These EUI estimates, along with building area data, will be used to calculate direct GHG building emissions.

In the first semester, the focus has been on developing the Energy Use Intensity (EUI) estimation technique, using globally available features to predict EUI. By selecting these key features, the goal has been to generate the first iteration of EUI predictions. The target for this stage is to achieve a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) in the range of 30-40%. While this is the ideal range for this milestone, it is possible that we may not meet this target at this stage. Refining and improving this technique will be the focus for the second semester.

In the second semester, the objective will be to refine the model by incorporating additional features and enhancing its performance. The final goal is to enable global EUI prediction, providing a high-resolution, actionable method for estimating direct GHG emissions from building energy use.

## 3. Background <a name="Background"></a>

The accurate estimation of anthropogenic CO2 emissions is critical for understanding global climate change and formulating effective policies. Existing estimates are provided by several key datasets, including the Open-source Data Inventory for Anthropogenic CO2 ([Oda, Maksyutov, & Andres, 2018](#oda2018)), the Community Emissions Data System ([McDuffie et al., 2020](#mcduffie2020)), the Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR) ([Janssens-Maenhout et al., 2019](#janssens2019)), the Global Carbon Grid ([Tong et al., 2018](#tong2018)), and the Global Gridded Daily CO2 Emissions Dataset ([Dou et al., 2022](#dou2022)). While the GRACED data is updated nearly monthly, most of the other key datasets suffer from a significant production latency, often of a year or more. Additionally, the highest resolution available across these datasets is 0.1 decimal degrees, roughly equivalent to an 11 km grid near the equator. Furthermore, only a few of these datasets provide detailed breakdowns of emissions by sector, such as residential and commercial subsectors, or offer separate estimates for different greenhouse gases([Markakis et al., 2023](#markakis2023)).

In response to these challenges, recent advancements have been made in the development of more granular and timely emissions estimation methods. One such breakthrough is the High-resolution Global Building Emissions Estimation using Satellite Imagery model by [Markakis et al. (2023)](#markakis2023). This innovative model offers high-resolution, global emissions estimates for both residential and commercial buildings at a 1 kmÂ² resolution, with updates on a monthly basis. By leveraging satellite imagery-derived features and machine learning techniques, the model estimates direct emissions from buildings. This approach addresses the temporal and spatial limitations of previous datasets by predicting building areas, estimating energy use intensity, and calculating emissions based on regional fuel mixes. Unlike other datasets like GRACED and EDGAR, this model offers more granular insights into emissions at a higher frequency and resolution, making it a crucial tool for policymakers working to reduce emissions in the building sector on a global scale.


## 4. Data and Features Overview <a name="DataAndFeaturesOverview"></a>

### 4.1 GHG Estimation <a name="GHGEstimation"></a>

To estimate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from buildings, we will use Energy Use Intensity (EUI) as a central metric. EUI measures the energy consumption per square meter of building space, making it a valuable indicator for emissions estimation. By combining EUI values with total building floor area and an emissions factor, we can calculate the GHG emissions associated with buildings.

The estimation formula is:
![Formula](/figures/01_formula.png)

### 4.2 Features for EUI Prediction <a name="FeaturesForEUIPrediction"></a>

In this section, we describe both the dependent variable of our model (EUI) and the independent features we are exploring to predict Energy Use Intensity (EUI) in buildings. The independent features include factors that are considered potentially influential on energy consumption, based on both prior research and discussions with experts in the field. These independent features serve as inputs to the model, and some of them are used to calculate additional derived features, such as the Heating Degree Days (HDD) and Comfort Index, which are explained further in the Feature Engineering section. Below, we outline the open datasets we are using to build and refine our EUI prediction model.

1. **[EUI](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=12qGq_DLefI1RihIF_RKQUyJtm480-xRC)**:
EUI is a metric used to measure the intensity of energy use in buildings. These EUI values serve as our dependent variable, or the target we seek to predict, in our model. This dataset, provided by the client, contains 482 entries and focuses on two key variables:

   - Residential EUI:  Indicates the energy consumption of residential buildings, expressed in kWh/mÂ²/year.
   - Non-Residential EUI: Reflects the energy consumption of non-residential buildings, also expressed in kWh/mÂ²/year.
  
To better understand the distribution of this variable, we can observe the following map, which visualizes how EUI is distributed across the different regions and building types.

![EUI map](/figures/02_eui_map.png)

2. **[Temperature](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/datasets/derived-era5-land-daily-statistics?tab=overview)**: Provides daily temperature statistics, offering insights into climate-related factors that influence energy use.

3. **[Latitude](https://download.geonames.org/export/dump/)**: Provides global latitude data in decimal degrees (WGS84 coordinate reference system), adding geographical context to our analysis.

4. **[Longitude](https://download.geonames.org/export/dump/)**: Provides global longitude data in decimal degrees (WGS84 coordinate reference system), complementing the latitude data for geographical analysis.

5. **[Population](https://globaldatalab.org/shdi/metadata/pop/)**: Includes population data for various countries and regions from 1960 to 2023. For our analysis, we extracted the population figures for 2023 to align with our project goals.

6. **[GDP](https://globaldatalab.org/shdi/metadata/shdi/)**: Contains data on human development, health, education, and income across 160+ countries from 1990 to 2022. We used the GDP values for 2022 as a key feature for our model.

7. **[Human Development Index (HDI)](https://globaldatalab.org/shdi/metadata/shdi/)**: HDI measures a country's achievements in three key areas:  
   - *Health*: A long and healthy life.  
   - *Knowledge*: Access to education.  
   - *Standard of Living*: A decent standard of living.  
   We extracted data for the year 2022 to maintain consistency with other datasets.

8. **[Urbanization Rate](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.URB.TOTL.IN.ZS?end=2023&start=2023&view=map&year=2022)**: Urbanization rate reflects the average annual growth of urban populations. For consistency, we used data from 2022.

9. **[Educational Index](https://globaldatalab.org/shdi/metadata/edindex/)**: This index comprises two indicators:  
   - *Mean Years of Schooling (MYS)*: The average years of schooling for adults aged 25 and above.  
   - *Expected Years of Schooling (EYS)*: The anticipated years of education for the current population.  

10. **[Paris Agreement](https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement)**: The Paris Agreement is an international treaty adopted by 196 parties in 2015. We used this information to create a binary variable to indicate whether a country is a signatory.


### 4.3 Generated Data <a name="GeneratedData"></a>
After feature engineering and merging our datasets, we've generated the final dataset for model input, containing 482 data points. It can be accessed [here](https://github.com/AliciaXia222/Capstone-Team-Climate-Trace/blob/main/data/03_processed/merged_df.csv)

## 5. Methods <a name="Methods"></a>

### 5.1 Feature Engineering <a name="FeatureEngineering"></a>
Feature engineering is essential to transform raw data into meaningful representations that enhance model performance and predictive accuracy. In this study, we applied the following techniques:  

1. **Heating Degree Days Calculation:**  
   Calculated using temperature data to derive features measure the demand for heating energy based on the difference between outdoor temperature and a baseline "comfort" temperature, typically 65Â°F (18Â°C).
   
2. **Cooling Degree Days Calculation:**  
   Calculated using temperature data to derive features measure the demand for Cooling related energy usage based on the difference between outdoor temperature and a baseline "comfort" temperature, typically 71.6Â°F (22Â°C). 

3. **GDP per Capita Calculation:**
We use GDP per capita, which is the result of dividing total GDP by the population, as it provides more relevant information for our model. This approach better captures the economic impact on energy consumption at the individual level, enabling more accurate comparisons across regions with varying population sizes.

4. **Cross-Feature Interaction:**  
   Combined multiple features to create new interaction terms that capture relationships between variables.  

### 5.2 Nearest Reference Mapping <a name="NearestReferenceMapping"></a>

Nearest Reference Mapping involves assign each data point to its closest reference location based on a defined distance metric, enriching the dataset with relevant features from these reference points. 

In this project, we aim to assigning **EUI values** to each data point based on its nearest starting point with known ground truth. By using the EUI values as features and incorporating spatial context into our model, we aim to improve the modelâ€™s starting point and enhance prediction accuracy for global projections. 

### 5.3 Supervised Machine Learning <a name="SupervisedMachineLearning"></a>  


In this project, we will employ a range of supervised machine learning models to predict and analyze the target variable. The following models will be utilized:

1. **Linear Regression:**  
   We will use Linear Regression to model the relationship between the input features and the target variable. This model is suitable for capturing linear relationships and will serve as a baseline for comparison with more complex models.

2. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):**  
   KNN is a non-parametric model that classifies a data point based on the majority class or average value of its nearest neighbors. It is particularly useful for capturing local patterns in the data and will provide a comparison to Linear Regression in terms of flexibility.

3. **Random Forest:**
   Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting. It is particularly useful for handling high-dimensional data and capturing complex, non-linear relationships.

4. **Ensemble Models:**
   - **XGBoost:**  
     XGBoost is an optimized gradient boosting algorithm that performs well in a variety of prediction tasks. It builds an ensemble of decision trees sequentially, improving the modelâ€™s performance by reducing bias and variance.
   
   - **CatBoost:**  
     CatBoost is another gradient boosting algorithm known for its handling of categorical features without the need for explicit preprocessing. It is expected to provide competitive results, particularly in datasets with mixed types of variables.

The combination of linear models, distance-based methods like KNN, and powerful ensemble models like XGBoost and CatBoost will allow us to capture a range of patterns in the data, from simple linear trends to more complex interactions and non-linear relationships.

### 5.4 Experimental Design <a name="ExperimentalDesign"></a>
Given the challenge of regional variations in global data, we will validate our predictions at the regional level across five distinct regions using three strategies to identify biases and improve model robustness. The regions we are using are defined as follows:

Given the challenge of regional variations in global data, we will validate our predictions at the regional level across five distinct regions using three strategies to identify biases and improve model robustness. This approach helps to account for local differences in energy use patterns and improve the modelâ€™s predictive accuracy across diverse contexts. The regions we are using are defined as follows:

1. Asia & Oceania
2. Europe
3. Africa
4. Central and South America
5. Northern America

The data points in our dataset, which we intend to predict, are distributed across these various regions, as illustrated in the following map.


![Geographic Distribution of Data Points by Region](/figures/03_region_map.png)

The strategies we will be using are as follows:

![Image](/figures/04_experimental_design.png)

We aim to assess our model's generalization by comparing its performance within the same region (Within-Domain) and its ability to extrapolate to other regions (Cross-Domain). The goal is to reduce the gap between these strategies to improve accuracy and understand extrapolation errors. Additionally, we want to understand if there are regions that perform better than others in specific outcomes, which can help us tailor our model to regional differences.

## 6. Experiments <a name="Experiments"></a>


### 6.1 Feature Importance <a name="FeatureImportance"></a>

To find the most important factors in building energy use and greenhouse gas emissions, we used a linear regression model. The target variable, energy use intensity (EUI), was calculated as the total of residential and non-residential energy use (kWh/mÂ²/year).

The model included factors like GDP per capita, urbanization rate, latitude, and subnational HDI. To make all variables comparable, we standardized the data before training the model. Heating Degree Days (HDD), which measures heating demand based on temperature, turned out to be the most important factor, showing how much temperature affects energy use.

In the future, the model could include other temperature-related factors, like average temperature and humidity, which were not included in this iteration. For details on the calculations, check the [Feature Importance Notebook](/notebooks/050_FeatureImportance.ipynb).   

![Feature Importance](/figures/05_feature_importance.png)

### 6.2 Models <a name="Models"></a>

As part of the initial iterations of the model, the following results were obtained using Linear Regression. In this iteration, we used features such as heating degree days, cooling degree days, GDP per capita, urbanization rate in 2022, latitude, longitude, the Paris Agreement, human development index, educational index, and income index. This model serves as a baseline, providing a starting point for future improvements and model refinements.

## 7. Conclusion <a name="Conclusion"></a>


The linear regression model's performance varies significantly across experimental strategies and regions. For the Within-Domain strategy, the model achieves relatively better average performance, with MAPE values ranging from 17.7% to 20.3% for both residential and non-residential EUI predictions. However, examining individual regions reveals greater variability. In Cross-Domain scenarios, performance deteriorates notably, with MAPE values increasing to 32-40%, highlighting the model's limited ability to generalize across geographical regions. The All-Domain approach yields intermediate results, suggesting that including data from multiple regions during training helps balance the model's predictive capabilities.

A closer regional analysis reveals distinct performance patterns. Europe shows consistent predictions across all domains.

The negative RÂ² values across multiple scenarios highlight the limitations of the baseline linear regression model in capturing the complex relationships between features and EUI values. This suggests that further iterations are needed to improve performance.

In future models, we will test techniques such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest, and CatBoost, which could better capture nonlinear patterns. We will also incorporate additional variables like average temperature and humidity to enhance predictive accuracy.
