## Abstract <a name="Abstract"></a>
This project develops a machine learning model to estimate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from building energy consumption. By predicting energy use intensity (EUI) using variables such as heating degree days (HDD), humidity, Human Development Index (HDI), educational index, income index, and GDP per capita, the model will generate estimates of energy consumption for both residential and non-residential buildings. These EUI estimates, along with global building floor area data provided by our client, will be used to calculate GHG emissions, offering a timely, high-resolution approach to estimating emissions at a global scale.


## Introduction <a name="Introduction"></a>

Global warming is one of the most critical challenges of our time, and addressing it requires accurately identifying the main sources of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Climate TRACE, a global non-profit coalition, has made significant progress in independently tracking emissions with a high level of detail, covering approximately 83% of global emissions. However, the building sector, which represents a substantial portion of global energy consumption and GHG emissions, lacks timely, high-resolution, low-latency data on energy use and related emissions. Current methods are often outdated, with data available only after a year or more, or rely on self-reported information that is not available on a global scale. This data gap limits policymakersâ€™ ability to focus their efforts effectively.

Our project focuses on emissions from the building sector. Buildings contribute between 6% and 9% of global emissions when considering only direct emissions, which primarily result from onsite fossil fuel combustion used for space heating, water heating, and cooking. Emissions from lighting, consumer electronics, and most air conditioning are excluded, as these are typically electric and accounted for separately within Climate TRACE.

This project is focused on developing a machine learning model to estimate GHG emissions based on building energy consumption. The model will predict energy use intensity (EUI) using predictive variables such as temperature, humidity, and socioeconomic data, along with global building floor area data from Climate TRACE. These EUI estimates, along with building area data, will be used to calculate direct GHG emissions, providing building emissions data in 1-kilometer-by-1-kilometer grid cells.

## Methods <a name="Methods"></a>

### Building Emissions Estimation <a name="BuildingEmissionsEstimation"></a>

To estimate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from buildings, we will use Energy Use Intensity (EUI) as a central metric. EUI measures the energy consumption per square meter of building space, making it a valuable indicator for emissions estimation. By combining EUI values with total building floor area and an emissions factor, we can calculate the GHG emissions associated with buildings.

The estimation formula is:

### Identifying Features <a name="IdentifyingFeatures"></a>

Because we will predict energy use intensity from building, it mainly includes direct emissions, which primarily results from onsite fossil fuel combustion used for space heating, water heating, and cooking. To describe these factors through data, we found below datasets from open resources match our need. 
1. EUI [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=12qGq_DLefI1RihIF_RKQUyJtm480-xRC): Our ground truth data of energy use intensity provided by client. It includes 482 lines of data and two main clumns, one is "residential EUI" which indicates the EUI calculated from residential building area, the other one is "non-residential EUI" which indicates the EUI calculated by non-residential building area.
2. Population [World Bank Group](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL): This dataset provides population data for various countries and regions from 1960 to 2023. It includes the country/region name, indicator name which is population total, and the population figures for each year, we only keep the population in 2023 to align closely with our main goal.
3. GDP [Global Data Lab](https://globaldatalab.org/shdi/metadata/shdi/): This dataset contains human development, health, education and income within and across 160+ countries from 1990 to 2022, we used it as our main resource to extract several features one is GDP. We kept year of 2022 as our GDP variable.
4. Human Development Index [Global Data Lab](https://globaldatalab.org/shdi/metadata/shdi/):

### Feature Importance <a name="Feature Importance"></a>

To identify the most influential variables in building energy consumption and their greenhouse gas emissions, we used a linear regression model, which allows us to directly assess the relevance of each variable in predicting energy use intensity (EUI). Among all the features, Heating Degree Days (HDD), defined as a measure of heating demand based on temperature, proved to be the most significant factor, highlighting the importance of temperature in energy consumption. This suggests that, in future iterations of the model, it would be useful to explore temperature-related variables, such as average temperature, along with humidity, to improve the estimation of emissions in the building sector.
